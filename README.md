# PlantKart - Flutter UI

**Packages we are using:**

- flutter_svg: [link](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg)

Nice clean plant app UI using Flutter. The Home page has a search box, a horizontal list of recommended plants, and at the bottom, a featured plants list. On the details page, thereâ€™s a big image with 4 icons on the right side, and an add-to-cart button.
